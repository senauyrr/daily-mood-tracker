# Daily Mood Tracker 🧠💜

This is a simple desktop application I developed as part of the COMP1002 – Advanced Python course.  
It helps users track their mood daily and review their emotional history for the past week. My main goal was to create something useful while practicing object-oriented programming and GUI development using Python.

## 🎯 Purpose

The project aims to encourage daily mood tracking by allowing users to choose how they feel, save that data, and visualize their past entries.  
It also served as a personal challenge to apply what I've learned in Python so far.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Tkinter** – for GUI interface
- **JSON** – for data storage
- **datetime** – for handling dates and times
- **os** – for file path checks

## 📷 Features

- Simple, lilac-themed GUI
- Emoji-supported mood selection (e.g., 😊 Happy, 😌 Calm)
- “Save” button to record mood of the day
- Display of the last 7 days' mood entries (e.g., `23.05.25 happy`)
- Local data storage using a JSON file
- Modular structure using object-oriented programming (OOP)

## 🧪 How to Use

1. Run the application with `python mood_tracker.py`
2. Select your mood for the day
3. Click the “Save” button to log your mood
4. See your mood history update in real time

## 📌 Notes

- I focused on keeping the code clean, readable, and beginner-friendly.
- The entire code was written by me, with occasional help from documentation and Python examples.
- This project is open to further development. Some ideas:
  - Recommending a song that matches the selected mood 🎵
  - Letting the user write short notes about how they feel 📝
  - Visualizing mood trends with weekly graphs 📊
